# C# / Blazor - First time with both.

First time writing code in C#, using the .Net Framework.  Created a Blazor Web Assembly application, that has simple create, read and delete functionality, styled very minimally by Bootstrap.

No real previous experience with C#, nor the .Net Framework, and I've only uploaded the relevent file I was working in.
